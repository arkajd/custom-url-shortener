Spring Boot application for URL shortener.

Run the application and make sure it is running on port 8083. If the port is occupied, try another available port.

Step 1:
    Send a request GET - http://localhost:8083/url-shortener
    It will return a HTML form page.
        - Enter full URL (required) (should be http or https)
        - Enter any alias you want to give to your short URL (optional) (if not provided, a hash value is generated)
        - Press SUBMIT

Step 2:
    HTML page with short URL generated
    Click on the short URL

Step 3:
    You are redirected to full URL


Points to remember:
    - try giving meaningful names, as if you try to enter same alias for other full URL's, the alias will be overridden
    - This application check the URL entered. If wrong, it returns an error page
    - Guava's murmur3 library is used to generate consistent hash of the full URL
